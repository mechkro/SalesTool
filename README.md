# SalesTool
A Tkinter driven framework designed to assist with my personal occupational needs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1/3/19 - realized as my project has grown and increasingly has more connected features and components that version
control is an absolute necc.  

        - Creating copies of files every time I wanted to make major changes was an effecient process
        - At this date most of the files on backend are solid. (No TESTING @ this point) 
    
    
    GOALS:
    
        - improve front end
        - do proper git and python file structuring and supply
        - add Testing
        - improve user first setup experience. All code with referalls to OS have been
        coded with direct file locs on my pc instead of proper distribution type inquiry
        
        - More to come.
        
        
     *EDIT*** ---- some of the code is very messy. Should have waited to upload until checked
     for  sensitive data and or presentation.!!!

Wed 12/8/2019 ------

        - Have been working towards porting code to python 3.
        - Refactoring code.
                - Has distracted me from ironing out the core processes.
        
        - Have worked towards my goal of having modular easily read code.
                - Have a controller and settings file to initialize all of the 
                main function windows through deleting frames and re-creating them
                as page changes.
